# Simon-Game

Simon Game is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to follow a sequence of colours and sounds. With each turn, the game adds a new element to the pattern, testing players' memory and concentration. The goal is to repeat the correct sequence as it becomes increasingly complex, providing a fun and rewarding challenge for players to enjoy individually or in competitive settings.
